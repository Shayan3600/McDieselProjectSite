We’re not just fighting—we have a plan.

Set Up a New Government – No more fragmented states. We establish an interim government that actually represents the people.
Write a Constitution – A real one, not some symbolic nonsense. Guarantees free speech, assembly, and a fair legal system.
Fix the Borders – A proper, unified Germany. No more patchwork of territories run by random princes.
Secure Civil Liberties – Freedom of the press, religious freedom, and actual legal protections.
Economic & Social Reforms – End feudal laws, better labor rights, and fairer wages.
Rebuild & Unite – Get rid of old rivalries, promote national unity, and make sure everyone has a place in the new Germany.
International Recognition – Get other European nations to recognize the new Germany and protect its borders.
</strong>If we win, we change history.<strong>
