Meet the Revolutionaries
These are the people leading the charge:

Gustav Struve – Another Baden revolutionary. Keeps coming back for more even after failed attempts.

Franz Sigel – Military strategist helping the revolution stay organized. Plans defenses and strategies.
      
Hermann von Natzmer – The Prussian officer who refused to fire on revolutionaries. Got locked up for it but escaped.
      
Karl Ludwig Johann D’Ester – Socialist, democrat, and key political mind in the movement.
      
August Willich – A former Prussian military officer who’s now leading an armed resistance.
      
Friedrich Engels – Yes, that Engels. Co-wrote The Communist Manifesto, fought in the revolution, and helped organize workers.
      
Robert Blum – Politician, activist, and democratic leader. Executed in Vienna for his role in the uprising.
