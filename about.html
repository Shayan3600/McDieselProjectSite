    <h2>What Do We Want?</h2>
    
<h2>We’re done with oppressive rulers, censorship, and outdated systems. The revolution is about a vauge variety of things:</h2>
<p>
•  A Unified Germany – No more scattered states with different laws. One nation, one government.
•  Freedom & Rights – No more censorship, actual free speech, and a government that listens.
•  A Fairer System – No more feudalism, better working conditions, and real economic reform.
•  We’re not just dreamers—this is happening. The Frankfurt Parliament is working on a constitution, and the people want change. 
•  If you’re on the fence, just ask yourself: Do you want a future where you actually have a say? Where what you think and want, MATTERS?!?
•  Get to work.
