      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        On March 9, 1848, citizens of Hanau joined a revolutionary surge across the German Confederation. They challenged the rule of Prince-Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse, demanding a unified and modern Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by uprisings in Paris and Sicily, demonstrators in cities like Berlin, Vienna, and Dresden built barricades, rallied against censorship, and fought for fundamental freedoms. Despite high hopes, the movement faded by 1849—yet its legacy lives on in symbols like the black-red-gold flag.
